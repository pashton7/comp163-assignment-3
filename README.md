 ## Concept and Theme
 In this game you take the role of a spaceship captain who must make decisions on what ship they wish to fly and how they wish to navigate their environment. Players will have to make tough decisions that will have an impact on how their game ends.
 ## Branching Logic
 Each if/elif statement checks to see if the player input meets the specific requirements and if not tells the user that they entered something wrong. Within some of the decisions lie nested if statements, these are to provide further decisions that effect the end of the game.
 ## Endings
 There are six endings with one default ending incase the checks for other endings return false. Endings are based on the health of the players ship, the amount of money they have, and how many remaining crew members there are.
